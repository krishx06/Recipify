## 3. Problem Statement  
Many people in India struggle with deciding what to cook based on the ingredients they have. Existing recipe apps often focus on Western cuisines, fail to understand local ingredient names in Hindi/regional languages, and don’t offer an AI-based personalized experience.  

## 4. Proposed Solution / Idea  
Recipify solves this by using AI and real-time recipe APIs to help users quickly discover meals based on their inputs and preferences.
The app allows users to:
- Enter available ingredients to get recipe suggestions
- Get AI-generated recipes using Google Gemini
- Explore recipes even without entering ingredients
- Filter recipes by cuisines (Italian, Indian, Mexican, Chinese, American, etc.)
- Save favorite recipes
- Log in securely using Supabase Google OAuth

## 5. Key Features  
- **Ingredient-based recipe suggestions** (supports English & Hindi names for ingredients)  
- **AI-powered recipe generator** (Gemini)
- **Cuisine filters:** Indian, Italian, Mexican, Chinese, American & more
- **Exploration mode** for discovering new recipes
- **Random recipe picker** for instant inspiration
